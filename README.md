# droveBank

Requirements:  python v 3.6
Test Environment:  Linux Mint v 17.1
IDE Used: PyCharm

To install the program:
Copy all the files into a directory where you have read/write access.  Files will be created in the current working directory thus the need for write access.

To run the program:
python3 tkgui.py

A Few Notes:
1) I only used whole dollar amounts - pigs don't have pockets and coins would quickly be lost :-)
2) I started building a database structure for future growth, but did not implement it yet.
3) This system was stright forward - multicore access was not necessary at this point, but this would be implemented in future versions
4) GUI programming is not my forte so I utilize either code generators or other people's code - the requirement to use internal functions
  only forced the seletion of TK for the GUI which I had to learn for this exercise.
